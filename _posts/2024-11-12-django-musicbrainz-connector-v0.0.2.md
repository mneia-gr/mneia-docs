title:  "Django MusicBrainz Connector v0.0.2"
---

**Django MusicBrainz Connector** is a Django app that connects to replica of the MusicBrainz database. In this second
release, we added models `ArtistCredit`, `LinkType`, `Link`, `Recording`, and `RecordingWorkLink`, in addition to the
already existing `Work` and `WorkType`.

You can find the [package on PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/django-musicbrainz-connector/), the
[code on GitHub](https://github.com/mneia-gr/django-musicbrainz-connector), and the
[documentation on Read The Docs](https://django-musicbrainz-connector.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).
